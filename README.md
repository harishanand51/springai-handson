### **AI-Powered Image Generation**
The **AI Image Generation Service** enables **text-to-image generation**.

#### **Key Features:**
- **DALLÂ·E Integration** for AI-driven image creation.
- User-defined prompts to generate dynamic images.
- REST API implementation for frontend compatibility.

---

### **AI Audio Processing**
This project covers **AI-driven Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech** functionalities.

#### **Key Features:**
- Converts **audio files to text** using AI models.
- Generates **speech from text** via OpenAIâ€™s audio APIs.
- REST API endpoints for AI-based audio processing.

---

### **Multi-Model AI Service**
The **Multi-Model AI Service** allows dynamic switching between AI providers like **OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Amazon Bedrock**.

#### **Key Features:**
- Centralized **Spring Boot** microservice to interact with different AI models.
- Supports **multiple AI integrations** for flexibility.
- Provides a unified API layer for **multi-provider AI access**.
